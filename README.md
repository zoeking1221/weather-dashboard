Refactored Work Day Scheduler starter code. Work Day Scheduler provides a one day calendar with time blocks of the workday (between 9am-5pm). The top of the calendar displays the current day. When a user enters a task in an hour block and hits the save button, the task saves to local storage and reappears if user refreshes the page. Time blocks are color coded based on current time. Current hour block will appear red, all past time blocks will be grey, and future time blocks will be green.
