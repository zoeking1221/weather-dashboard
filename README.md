Created a Weather Dashboard to assist users in planning trips. Dashboard allows users to search a city and view the following weather data from that day: temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It also displays weather details for 5 days ahead. Dashboard saves all previously searched cities using local storage so user can easily access the weather data for those cities without searching again. Dashboard uses API from Open Weather Map for weather information.
